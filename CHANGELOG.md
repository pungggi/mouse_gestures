  - Press Alt+G (or "Mouse Gestures: Start QuickPad" command) to open overlay
  - Context-aware gesture mapping based on where QuickPad was invoked (editor, terminal, file type)
  - Auto-close after gesture completion or 6 seconds of inactivity
  - Press Escape to cancel overlay at any time

- **Enhanced Context Support**: QuickPad captures invocation context for intelligent gesture-to-command mapping
  - Same gesture can trigger different commands in editor vs explorer vs terminal
  - Automatic context condition generation when assigning new gestures
