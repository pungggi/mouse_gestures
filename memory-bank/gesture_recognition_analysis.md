# Complex Gesture Recognition Analysis

## Current Implementation Overview

The complex gesture recognition feature has been implemented in `webview/gesturePad.js` with the following key components:

1. **Sequence Tracking**: The system builds a gesture sequence string (e.g., "LRUDLR") by detecting direction changes during mouse movement.

2. **Direction Detection**: Uses angle-based detection (via `Math.atan2`) for more accurate direction determination, dividing the 360Â° space into four quadrants (R, D, L, U).

3. **Noise Filtering**: Implements two thresholds to filter out noise:

   - `minDirectionChange` (30 pixels): Minimum distance to register a direction change
   - `minVelocity` (0.2 pixels/ms): Minimum velocity for direction change

4. **Sequence Reporting**: Sends the full sequence string to the extension via `vscode.postMessage()`.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Extension-Webview Mismatch**: The webview sends a sequence in `details.sequence`, but the extension looks for a single direction in `details.direction`.

2. **Limited Direction Support**: Currently only supports cardinal directions (L, R, U, D), not diagonal movements (UR, UL, DR, DL) despite being mentioned in the README.

3. **Documentation Gap**: The README doesn't mention support for complex sequences like "LRUDLR".

4. **Fixed Thresholds**: The thresholds for direction change detection are hardcoded, not configurable by users.

5. **Limited Visual Feedback**: No visual indication of recognized gestures beyond the path drawing.
