# Project Progress: VS Code Gesture Pad (Webview Approach)

## Current Status (Ready for Testing with Custom Icon)

- **Date:** 2025-03-31
- **State:** Implemented configurable trigger button. Updated `package.json` to use custom `media/mouse.svg` for both Activity Bar and main extension icon. Bug fix for subscriptions applied. Redundant `activationEvents` removed.
- **Focus:** Ready for functional testing with the custom icon.

## What Works (Code Implementation)

- Memory Bank structure is established.
- `package.json` defines Activity Bar container (`media/mouse.svg` icon), webview view, main extension icon (`media/icon.png`), configuration setting (`mouseGestures.triggerButton`). `activationEvents` is empty (user preference). `main` points to `src/extension.js`.
- `GesturePadViewProvider` registered and implemented correctly in `src/extension.js` (subscription bug fixed).
- Provider resolves the webview view, loads external script `webview/gesturePad.js` securely.
- Provider reads configuration and sends updates to the webview.
- Webview script (`webview/gesturePad.js`) receives configuration and uses the specified trigger button.
- Webview script captures configured drag events, draws path (1px thick), clears path after gesture.
- Webview script sends `gestureDetected` messages for left/right swipes.
- Provider receives messages and executes `nextEditor`/`previousEditor` commands.
- `.vscodeignore` updated to include `out/**` and exclude `src/**` to package the compiled JavaScript.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps (Webview Approach)

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps (Webview Approach)

1.  **Testing:** User to restart debugger, check custom mouse icon in Activity Bar and Extensions view, open view, test gestures with default (right) button, change setting, test with other button. Verify path drawing/clearing and action execution.
2.  **Feedback & Iteration:** Address bugs or adjustments based on testing.
3.  **(Future):** Map 'up'/'down' gestures to commands.
4.  **(Future):** Refine gesture detection logic if needed.
5.  **(Future):** Improve styling or add configuration options.

## Known Issues & Blockers (Webview Approach)

- **User Experience:** The main challenge is ensuring the separate panel interaction feels intuitive and useful.
- **Webview Security:** Nonces and `localResourceRoots` implemented.
- **(Previous Blocker Resolved):** The reliance on internal commands is no longer an issue with the Webview approach.
- **Icon Issue:** Resolved by using custom `media/mouse.svg`.

## Decisions Log

- **2025-03-31:** Decided to initialize the project and Memory Bank based on the provided description and sample code. Prioritizing feasibility testing of the core mechanism (DOM access via internal command).
- **2025-03-31:** Implemented initial sample code into `src/extension.js` and removed TypeScript type annotations to resolve errors.
- **2025-03-31:** Added `onStartupFinished` to `activationEvents` in `package.json` as the extension was not activating.
- **2025-03-31:** Attempted to use ES Modules by adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json`, but reverted due to user preference.
- **2025-03-31:** Reverted `package.json` (removed `"type": "module"`) and updated `src/extension.js` to use CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`).
- **2025-03-31:** **FAILED:** Testing confirmed `_workbench.htmlRequest` command is not found. The initial approach is not viable.
- **2025-03-31:** **PIVOT:** Decided direct editor gesture capture is infeasible. Pivoted to implementing a dedicated "Gesture Pad" using a Webview panel, capturing left-click drag gestures within the panel. Updated Memory Bank accordingly.
- **2025-03-31:** Implemented initial Webview panel command, HTML/CSS/JS structure, including external script loading (`webview/gesturePad.js`), canvas path drawing, left-click drag capture, message passing, and basic left/right gesture action mapping.
- **2025-03-31:** Refactored to use `WebviewViewProvider` placing the view in the Activity Bar. Implemented path clearing and thinner line refinements.
- **2025-03-31:** Changed Activity Bar icon to `$(mouse)`. Added configuration setting (`mouseGestures.triggerButton`) to select left/right trigger button (default right) and implemented logic in extension/webview to use it.
- **2025-03-31:** **FIX:** Corrected error in `WebviewViewProvider` by passing the main `ExtensionContext.subscriptions` array to the provider and using it for registering disposables within `resolveWebviewView`.
- **2025-03-31:** Changed Activity Bar icon to `$(symbol-event)` for testing due to rendering issues with `$(mouse)`.
- **2025-03-31:** Removed redundant `activationEvents` from `package.json`.
- **2025-03-31:** Updated `.vscodeignore` to exclude `out/**` instead of `src/**` to ensure proper packaging.
- **2025-03-31:** Updated `package.json` to use `media/mouse.svg` for the Activity Bar view container icon.
- **2025-03-31:** **FIX:** Re-added `activationEvents` (`onView:gesturePadView`) to `package.json` as required by `vsce` publish tool.
- **2025-03-31:** Set main extension `icon` to `media/icon.png` (user preference). Set `main` to `src/extension.js` (no build step). Set `activationEvents` to `[]` (user preference). Ready for testing.
