# Project Progress: VS Code Gesture Pad (Webview Approach)

## Current Status (Ready for Testing with Custom Icon)

- **Date:** 2025-03-31
- **State:** Implemented configurable trigger button. Updated `package.json` to use custom `media/mouse.svg` for both Activity Bar and main extension icon. Bug fix for subscriptions applied. Redundant `activationEvents` removed.
- **Focus:** Ready for functional testing with the custom icon.

## What Works (Code Implementation)

- Memory Bank structure is established.
- `package.json` defines Activity Bar container (`media/mouse.svg` icon), webview view, main extension icon (`media/icon.png`), configuration setting (`mouseGestures.triggerButton`). `activationEvents` is empty (user preference). `main` points to `src/extension.js`.
- `GesturePadViewProvider` registered and implemented correctly in `src/extension.js` (subscription bug fixed).
- Provider resolves the webview view, loads external script `webview/gesturePad.js` securely.
- Provider reads configuration and sends updates to the webview.
- Webview script (`webview/gesturePad.js`) receives configuration and uses the specified trigger button.
- Webview script captures configured drag events, draws path (1px thick), clears path after gesture.
- Webview script sends `gestureDetected` messages for left/right swipes.
- Provider receives messages and executes `nextEditor`/`previousEditor` commands.
- `.vscodeignore` updated to include `out/**` and exclude `src/**` to package the compiled JavaScript.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps (Webview Approach)

1.  **FIXED (April 16, 2025):** The Extension-Webview Mismatch bug has been resolved by modifying `src/extension.js` to correctly use `details.sequence` instead of `details.direction`.

    **Testing:** User to restart debugger, check custom mouse icon in Activity Bar and Extensions view, open view, test gestures with default (right) button, change setting, test with other button. Verify path drawing/clearing and action execution.

2.  **Feedback & Iteration:** Address bugs or adjustments based on testing.
3.  **(Future):** Map 'up'/'down' gestures to commands.
4.  **(Future):** Refine gesture detection logic if needed.
5.  **(Future):** Improve styling or add configuration options.

## Known Issues & Blockers (Webview Approach)

- **User Experience:** The main challenge is ensuring the separate panel interaction feels intuitive and useful.
- **Webview Security:** Nonces and `localResourceRoots` implemented.
- **(Previous Blocker Resolved):** The reliance on internal commands is no longer an issue with the Webview approach.
- **Icon Issue:** Resolved by using custom `media/mouse.svg`.

## Decisions Log

- **2025-03-31:** Decided to initialize the project and Memory Bank based on the provided description and sample code. Prioritizing feasibility testing of the core mechanism (DOM access via internal command).
- **2025-03-31:** Implemented initial sample code into `src/extension.js` and removed TypeScript type annotations to resolve errors.
- **2025-03-31:** Added `onStartupFinished` to `activationEvents` in `package.json` as the extension was not activating.
- **2025-03-31:** Attempted to use ES Modules by adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json`, but reverted due to user preference.
- **2025-03-31:** Reverted `package.json` (removed `"type": "module"`) and updated `src/extension.js` to use CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`).
- **2025-03-31:** **FAILED:** Testing confirmed `_workbench.htmlRequest` command is not found. The initial approach is not viable.
- **2025-03-31:** **PIVOT:** Decided direct editor gesture capture is infeasible. Pivoted to implementing a dedicated "Gesture Pad" using a Webview panel, capturing left-click drag gestures within the panel. Updated Memory Bank accordingly.
- **2025-03-31:** Implemented initial Webview panel command, HTML/CSS/JS structure, including external script loading (`webview/gesturePad.js`), canvas path drawing, left-click drag capture, message passing, and basic left/right gesture action mapping.
- **2025-03-31:** Refactored to use `WebviewViewProvider` placing the view in the Activity Bar. Implemented path clearing and thinner line refinements.
- **2025-03-31:** Changed Activity Bar icon to `$(mouse)`. Added configuration setting (`mouseGestures.triggerButton`) to select left/right trigger button (default right) and implemented logic in extension/webview to use it.
- **2025-03-31:** **FIX:** Corrected error in `WebviewViewProvider` by passing the main `ExtensionContext.subscriptions` array to the provider and using it for registering disposables within `resolveWebviewView`.
- **2025-03-31:** Changed Activity Bar icon to `$(symbol-event)` for testing due to rendering issues with `$(mouse)`.
- **2025-03-31:** Removed redundant `activationEvents` from `package.json`.
- **2025-03-31:** Updated `.vscodeignore` to exclude `out/**` instead of `src/**` to ensure proper packaging.
- **2025-03-31:** Updated `package.json` to use `media/mouse.svg` for the Activity Bar view container icon.
- **2025-03-31:** **FIX:** Re-added `activationEvents` (`onView:gesturePadView`) to `package.json` as required by `vsce` publish tool.
- **2025-03-31:** Set main extension `icon` to `media/icon.png` (user preference). Set `main` to `src/extension.js` (no build step). Set `activationEvents` to `[]` (user preference). Ready for testing.

**Feature: Enhanced Gesture Matching**

- **Date:** 2025-04-16
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Enhanced the gesture matching logic in the `_handleGesture` method of `src/extension.js` to support:
  - Exact matching (primary approach)
  - Prefix matching (finds commands where gesture.startsWith(gc.gesture) is true)
  - Pattern matching (when enablePatternMatching is true)
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Added \_findPatternMatch method for pattern-based matching
  - Improved error handling with try/catch blocks
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging
  - Structured gesture matching in a clear three-step process
- **Files Modified:** `src/extension.js`
- **Impact:** Enables more flexible and intuitive gesture command matching, improving user experience by allowing partial and pattern-based matches.

**Feature: Gesture-to-Command Mapping**

- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added a configuration setting (`mouseGestures.gestureCommands`) allowing users to map specific mouse gestures (e.g., "R", "UD") to one or more VS Code commands. Supports sequential/parallel execution, arguments, and wait conditions.
- **Files Modified:** `package.json`, `src/extension.js`, `README.md`
- **Clarification:** Configuration supports complex gesture strings (e.g., "LRUDLR"), but recognition depends on the `webview/gesturePad.js` component's capabilities. Enhancing recognition requires updating `webview/gesturePad.js`.

**Feature: Complex Gesture Pattern Recognition â€” Major Milestone**

- **Date:** 2025-04-16
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** The extension now fully supports complex, multi-step gesture patterns (e.g., "LRUDLR") for advanced command execution. This enables users to define and trigger sophisticated command sequences using custom gesture strings, greatly expanding the extension's flexibility and power.

- **Technical Approach:**

  - **Sequence Tracking:** The webview script (`webview/gesturePad.js`) tracks the full sequence of directional changes during a mouse drag, building a gesture string (e.g., "LRUDLR").
  - **Direction Detection:** Uses angle-based detection (via `Math.atan2`) for accurate direction changes, with configurable thresholds for minimum distance and velocity to filter out noise.
  - **Noise Filtering:** Only significant, intentional direction changes are registered, reducing false positives.
  - **Message Passing:** The full gesture sequence is sent from the webview to the extension host using `vscode.postMessage`.
  - **Flexible Matching:** The extension (`src/extension.js`) supports exact, prefix, and pattern-based matching (when enabled) to map gesture sequences to commands.
  - **Configuration:** Users can define complex gesture-to-command mappings in the `mouseGestures.gestureCommands` setting, and adjust thresholds for gesture recognition.

- **Design Decisions:**

  - Adopted a sequence-based approach to allow for arbitrary, user-defined gesture patterns.
  - Made thresholds and matching strategies configurable to accommodate different user preferences and hardware.
  - Prioritized reliability and extensibility by optimizing the gesture recognition pipeline and error handling.

- **How Users Can Utilize This Functionality:**

  1. Open VS Code settings and configure `mouseGestures.gestureCommands` to map custom gesture strings (e.g., "LRUDLR") to one or more commands.
  2. Optionally adjust gesture recognition thresholds (`minDirectionChange`, `minVelocity`) and enable pattern matching for more flexible gesture mapping.
  3. Use the Gesture Pad view to perform complex gestures; the extension will recognize the full sequence and execute the mapped commands.
  4. Visual feedback and error handling improvements make it easier to experiment with and refine custom gestures.

- **Files Modified:** `webview/gesturePad.js`, `src/extension.js`, `package.json`
- **Impact:** Empowers users to create and use advanced, multi-directional gesture patterns for highly customizable workflows in VS Code.

**Feature: Diagonal Direction Support**

- **Date:** 2025-04-19
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added support for diagonal movements (DR, DL, UR, UL) in the gesture recognition system, enhancing the precision and versatility of gesture detection.
- **Technical Approach:**
  - Updated the angle-based direction detection in `detectDirectionChange` function to support 8 directions instead of just 4
  - Modified the `detectInitialDirection` function to use the same angle-based approach for consistent diagonal direction support
  - Added color definitions for diagonal directions in the `markerColors` object for visual feedback
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Used angle ranges to accurately detect diagonal movements:
    - R: -22.5Â° to 22.5Â°
    - DR: 22.5Â° to 67.5Â°
    - D: 67.5Â° to 112.5Â°
    - DL: 112.5Â° to 157.5Â°
    - L: 157.5Â° to -157.5Â°
    - UL: -157.5Â° to -112.5Â°
    - U: -112.5Â° to -67.5Â°
    - UR: -67.5Â° to -22.5Â°
  - Ensured consistent direction detection between initial and ongoing gesture movements
- **Files Modified:** `webview/gesturePad.js`
- **Impact:** Users can now perform more precise and complex gestures using diagonal movements, significantly expanding the range of possible gesture patterns and improving the overall user experience.

**Feature: Mouse Gestures Cheat Sheet**

- **Date:** 2025-04-28
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added a new command "Mouse Gestures: Show Cheat Sheet" that displays a visually organized cheat sheet of all configured gestures. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of gesture mappings, making it easier for users to reference and remember their custom gestures.
- **Technical Approach:**
  - Implemented a new command in `src/extension.js` to create a webview panel for the cheat sheet.
  - Created `webview/cheatSheet.js` to handle the rendering of gestures and commands within the webview.
  - Designed a responsive grid layout with cards for each gesture, including visual representations of gesture paths.
  - Enhanced command display with specific formatting for parallel and sequential commands.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Gesture visualizations start with a circle and use appropriately sized paths.
  - Commands are formatted to show only descriptions when available, and only the last part of command IDs after the final dot when descriptions are not available.
  - Parallel commands are displayed on separate lines with arrows (â†’).
  - Sequential commands are displayed on separate lines with numbering (1., 2., 3., etc.).
  - Used VS Code theme variables for consistent appearance and added hover effects for better interactivity.
- **Files Modified:** `src/extension.js`, `webview/cheatSheet.js`, `README.md`
- **Impact:** Greatly enhances user experience by providing an intuitive, visual reference for all configured gestures, reducing the learning curve and improving accessibility of custom mappings.
